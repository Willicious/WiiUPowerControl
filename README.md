# Wii U Power Control

This is a simple app for controlling the Wii U's power status.

You can choose to Soft Reboot / Full Reboot (power off and on), Sleep (amber LED) or Standby (red LED).

## Building

To build this make sure you have `devkitPro`, `devkitPPC` and `wut` installed via the dkp-pacman package manager. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and use the resulting wuhb.
